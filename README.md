# Elect-coin
Elect-coin Proposal Very Rough Draft

Problem:  Current Election Process has many points of compromise that unfavorable election results can open the door to 
          challenges.  This then leads to uncertainty and doubt as to the validity of the results. This undermines the 
          legitamacy of the elected official.  
          There need to be a process in place where election results are unquestionable and is considered final.
          Citezens are assured that the winning party is truely the one that they voted for.  

Solution:  Use of blockchain technology to mitigate all the failure points of the current election system. 
           Blockchain technology has no central server that can be compromised by an attacker. Is 10 servers go down 
	   for any reason the rest of the servers in the blockchain has the whole ledger so no information is lost. 
           Once a vote is cast, it is broadcasted to the blockchain and gets validated by the nodes. This transaction is immutable 
           which makes it final. Any attempt to change the current ledger will be discarded by the nodes.
           Registered voters identity can also be stored in the blockchain to ensure uniqueness and to mitigate identity theft. 
           The blockchain also ensures that only 1 vote is cast per registered voter. Inherent to the blockchain are technologies
           that will help streamline the voting process.  Blockchain solution also allows OFW (Overseas Filipino Workers) to 
           vote for their candidate with ease using smartphone/internet instead of making a trip to their consulate office. 


Platform:  Candidate platform for developing smart contracts:  Ethereum/Icon/Neo/Eos/Ark/Komodo/Quantum/Stratis/Credits
	
       	   Factors in choosing the Platform:

           1) Programming Language:
   
                  We need to decide what language we are going to use to create our smart contracts
		  Although Ethereum is well established and probably has the most DAPPS currently using it 
                  Devs will need to learn "Solidity"  which is ethereums native language

                  Stratis uses C#

                  Neo is more flexible with the language

          2) Cost:

                  Use of these platforms require some type of payment... in Ethereum and Neo ist gas. 

          3) Scalability:

                  We need to factor in the number of transactions per second that each platform can handle
                  Credits for example is claming to be able to handle 1M/sec scalable to 10M/sec


Other Blockchain solutions that will help our project:

 	1) Civic:  Civic has a solotion to validate identity 
	2) Quantstamp: We will utelize quantstamp technology to help with auditing our code. 
                       We need to check if they also run security audits
  

Legal:

 	We need to ensure that our coin does not even closely resemble a security. 
        Very important that elect-coin is classified as a utility token.
